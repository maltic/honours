Title:
RNA Folding: Beyond the Thermodynamic Hypothesis
Abstract:
Algorithmic prediction of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) secondary structure has been actively researched since the 1970s. RNA is a biologically active molecule with many poorly understood functions. Quick and accurate prediction of RNA structure is therefore essential for further elucidation of its role. The Thermodynamic Hypothesis, which is the fundamental dogma underlying protein folding algorithms, has been applied successfully to the RNA folding problem. Unfortunately, this success is only partial; RNA folding algorithms are currently not able to reliably predict correct structures. These algorithms typically globally optimize some scoring function, usually thermodynamic stability. This is in keeping with the Thermodynamic Hypothesis. In my investigation I hypothesize that local interactions are stronger than global interactions during RNA structure formation. To test this, optimally folded local structures were merged into complete secondary structures. This produced structures that were more accurate (compared to actual RNA) than corresponding globally optimized structures, using the same model of RNA folding. I argue that this constitutes strong support for my hypothesis. In addition, a new algorithm called `ab-splat', which is based on the computation of locally optimal windows, is introduced. This algorithm, while very naive, has comparable prediction accuracy to the RNAfold algorithm on which it is based (RNAfold is part of the popular Vienna RNA Suite). Additionally, it runs an order of magnitude faster, and uses less memory.
