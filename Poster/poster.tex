      \begin{block}{Introduction \& Motivation}
RNA is a biologically active molecule with many poorly understood functions. For example, it is,
\vspace{0.25in}
\begin{itemize}
\item Involved in regulation of DNA expression \\
\item Implicated in developmental pathways \\
\item A catalyst for many biological processes
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.25in}
            
Quick and accurate prediction of RNA structure is therefore essential. RNA folding algorithms are currently not able to reliably predict correct structures. These algorithms typically globally optimize some scoring function, usually thermodynamic stability. However, there is evidence that many RNAs fold into suboptimal states.

      \begin{block}{My Contribution}
		        I hypothesized that local interactions are stronger than global interactions during RNA structure formation. To test this, a sliding window was used to generate locally optimal structures, then various algorithms were devised to merge these substructures. For some window sizes, the resulting complete structures were more accurate than those predicted by state of the art algorithms, which globally optimize. This constitutes strong support for my hypothesis. In addition, a new algorithm called `$ab$-splat', which was based on the computation of locally optimal windows, was introduced.

            \rmfamily{A correctable subsystem $\cl{B}$ is said to be a \emph{unitarily-correctable code} (UCC) for $\cl{E}$ if the recovery operation is simply a conjugation-by-unitary channel $\cl{U}(\cdot) := U(\cdot)U^*$.
            \vspace{0.1in}
            \begin{itemize}\justifying	% the \justifying command forces the items in the list to have full justification (they don't by default)
              \item Since finding correctable subsystems in full generality is an extremely difficult problem, restricting our attention to unitarily-correctable codes seems potentially wise.
              \item These codes are of physical interest; they are codes in which the two-step process of recovery only involves the conjugation-by-unitary step (and not the projective measurement step).
              \item It has been shown \cite{KS06} that if a quantum channel $\cl{E}$ is unital, then we can unambiguously define \emph{the unitarily-correctable code algebra} of $\cl{E}$, denoted $UCC(\cl{E})$, to be the albebra composed of the direct sum of all of the unitarily-correctable codes.
              \item In terms of Figure~1, unitarily-correctable codes are those for which $p_1 = 1$ and $p_2 = p_3 = 0$ (i.e., there is just one block on the right).
            \end{itemize}}

        \end{column}
        \begin{column}{\onecolwid}\vspace{-.69in}
          \begin{block}{The Multiplicative Domain}
            \rmfamily{The \emph{multiplicative domain} of $\cl{E}$ \cite{Cho74}, denoted $MD(\cl{E})$, is defined to be the following set:
            \begin{align*}
              \big\{ a \in \cl{L}(\cl{H}) : & \, \cl{E}(a)\cl{E}(b) = \cl{E}(ab)\text{ and } \\
              & \, \cl{E}(b)\cl{E}(a) = \cl{E}(ba) \ \forall \, b \in \cl{L}(\cl{H}) \big\}.
            \end{align*}

            \begin{itemize}
              \item $\cl{E}$ behaves particularly nicely when restricted to $MD(\cl{E})$ (as a $*$-homomorphishm, in fact).
              \item $MD(\cl{E})$ was first studied by operator theorists over thirty years ago.
              \item $MD(\cl{E})$ is an algebra, and hence \cite{Dav96} is unitarily equivalent to a direct sum of tensor blocks:
              \begin{equation}\label{opalgform}
                MD(\cl{E}) \cong \oplus_k \big(I_{\mathcal{A}_k} \otimes \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{B}_k)\big) \, \oplus \, 0_\mathcal{K}.
              \end{equation}

        \rmfamily{By looking at Figures 1 and 2, we expect that there might be some connection between correctable subsystems for a channel $\cl{E}$ and its multiplicative domain. Indeed, one of our main results is that the two situations coincide when $\cl{E}$ is unital and the subsystem is unitarily-correctable.}

          \begin{itemize}\justifying
            \item This theorem says that when we write $MD(\cl{E})$ in the form of Equation~\eqref{opalgform}, the $\cl{B}_k$'s are exactly the unitarily-correctable codes for $\cl{E}$.
            \item When $\cl{E}$ is not unital, $MD(\cl{E})$ in general only captures a subclass of the unitarily-correctable codes for $\cl{E}$.
            \item Because $MD(\cl{E})$ is easy to compute, this provides a concrete method of finding some UCCs.

          \rmfamily{In the same spirit as the multiplicative domain, we can define ``generalized multiplicative domains'' for channels by requiring not that the channel be multiplicative with itself, but rather that it be multiplicative with some $*$-homomorphism.
          \begin{itemize}\justifying
            \item Generalized multiplicative domains capture \emph{all} correctable codes for \emph{arbitrary} channels.
            \item Unlike the multiplicative domain, these algebras in general are very difficult to compute.

    \begin{block}{Conclusions and Outlook}
      \rmfamily{This characterization provides a simple way to find all unitarily-correctable codes for unital channels and even some codes for non-unital channels. General correctable subsystems can be characterized in terms of algebras that are analogous to the multiplicative domain, though in general it is not clear how to calculate them -- further research in this area would be of great interest.}
